ARRAYArrayLinearåIn coding and programming, an array is a collection of items, or data, stored in contiguous memory locations, also known as database systems . The purpose of an array is to store multiple pieces of data of the same type together.BINARY SEARCH TREETree
Non-Linear›In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.GRAPHGraphs
Non-Linear·A graph is an abstract data type that can be used to represent complex, non-linear relationships between objects. A graph consists of nodes (also called vertices) that are connected by edges (also called arcs). Graphs have a lot of key terms: When two nodes are connected by an edge, they are called neighbours.
HASH TABLEHash
Non-Linear´A hash table is a data structure that is used to store keys/value pairs. It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array in which an element will be inserted or searched.HEAPTree
Non-LinearåIn computer science, a heap is a tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: In a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C.LINKED LISTListLinearŒA linked list is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in the list is called a node, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the list is called the tailLISTListLinear¢In computer science, a list or sequence is an abstract data type that represents a finite number of ordered values, where the same value may occur more than once.QUEUEAbstractLinearåIn computer science, a queue is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence.SELF-BALANCE TREETree
Non-LinearïIn computer science, a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions.SETAbstract
Non-Linear±In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set.STACKAbstractLinearßIn computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements with two main operations: Push, which adds an element to the collection, and. Pop, which removes the most recently added element.TWO DIMENSION ARRAYArrayLinear›What is a Two-Dimensional Array? A two-dimensional array, also known as a 2D array, is a collection of data elements arranged in a grid-like structure with rows and columns. Each element in the array is referred to as a cell and can be accessed by its row and column indices/indexes.
